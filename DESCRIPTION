Description: An interface to the powerful and fairly complete computer algebra system 'Maxima'.
    It can be used to start and control 'Maxima' from within R by entering 'Maxima' commands. 
    Results from 'Maxima' can be parsed and evaluated in R. 
    It facilitates outputting results from 'Maxima' in 'LaTeX' and 'MathML'. 
    2D and 3D plots can be displayed directly. 
    This package also registers a 'knitr'-engine enabling 'Maxima' code chunks 
    to be written in 'RMarkdown' documents.
